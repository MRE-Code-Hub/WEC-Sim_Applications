# NonlinearHydro

**Author:**          Yi-Hsiang Yu and Kelley Ruehl

**WEC-Sim Version:** v2.2

Example using [Nonlinear Hydro](http://wec-sim.github.io/WEC-Sim/features.html#non-linear-hydrodynamics) to run WEC-Sim for a [heaving ellipsoid](http://wec-sim.github.io/WEC-Sim/features.html#non-linear-tutorial-heaving-ellipsoid). Inlcudes exzamples of running non-linear hydrodynamics with different [fixed and variable time-step solvers](http://wec-sim.github.io/WEC-Sim/features.html#time-step-features), and different regular wave formulations (with/without CIC).
