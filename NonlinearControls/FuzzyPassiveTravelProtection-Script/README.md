A fuzzy logic controller which attempts to limit the range of motion of RM3 using the PTO device, shedding power to limit stress.

The range of motion limits were set for an expected waveheight of 2m. When not near the limits, an optimal passive damping control strategy for a period of 10s is used.

The fuzzy controller is implemented using a script which does not require the MATLAB Fuzzy Logic Toolbox. This script can be adapted to for other fuzzy controller designs.
