**WEC-Sim Version:** v2.2

Example using ParaView data visualization for WEC-Sim coupled with [MoorDyn](http://wec-sim.github.io/WEC-Sim/features.html#using-moordyn) to simulate a more realistic mooring system for the [RM3 example](http://wec-sim.github.io/WEC-Sim/tutorials.html#two-body-point-absorber-rm3).
